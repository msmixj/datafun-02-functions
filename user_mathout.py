Task 3 Questions/Answer:
     4. How many arguments does get_area_of_lot() take?
               -The function, get_area_of_lot takes two arguments.
     5. What does it return?
               -After fixing, this will return the length*width.
---------------------------------------------
Explore some functions in the math module

1. Use the defensive math examples to call the permutations and combinations as shown:
math.combs(5,1) = 5
math.perms(5,1) = 5

your code here

2. Then, call the method you just fixed with several different arguments and display
them for the user:
6
98
270
Above are the returns for the custom function(get_area_of_lot),
using arguments of (3,2), (7,14), and (30,9), respectively.

How many arguments are needed? 2
Call get_area_of_lot(6,2) and display the result:
12

3. Write and call custom functions with examples:
     1. Minutes Per Game (For return, see below)

4. Three more simple functions that are useful to my domain (see returns below):
     1. Average Points Per Quarter
     2. Team Free Throw Percentage
     3. Sum of players rebounds

Returns here:
minutes_per_game(4,7) = 28
avg_points_per_quarter(22,10,20,35) = 21.75
team_free_throw_perc(9,3,5,8,0,2) = 58
Total Rebounds = 25.0
